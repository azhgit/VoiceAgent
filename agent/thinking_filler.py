    Why only tool calls, not every LLM turn: checked empirically
    (see the eval_dispatch_classification.py-style probe run this session)
    that Haiku's own first-turn text already says something like "Let me
    check what we have available" before it calls a tool - so an earlier
    version of this processor that armed on UserStoppedSpeakingFrame (any
    caller-finished-talking gap) would sometimes fire its own filler phrase
    right on top of that, sounding redundant right before the real answer.
    The tool-call round trip (CRM HTTP call + a second LLM turn to produce
    the spoken result) is the gap that ISN'T already covered by the model's
    own transitional text, so that's what this now specifically targets.

    duplicating the transitional text the model already says before the
    tool call itself (see ToolCallStartedFrame's docstring for why that
    distinction matters).

    Fires at most once per tool call: disarms on BotStartedSpeakingFrame
    (the real response is coming, no filler needed) and on
    UserStartedSpeakingFrame (the caller is talking again, don't talk over
    them). The only way to re-arm is the next ToolCallStartedFrame, so
